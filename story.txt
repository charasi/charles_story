Hi My name is charles and this is my story.

Hi Charles! I am Yuzheng. Looking forward to working with you!!! 

Same here thanks!

I really like chicken nuggets. Yesterday, I slapped a chicken and so many chicken nuggets fell out of it. I ate 
all of them up. Yummy, so delicious! I then took some Cumin spice and rubbed it into my chicken nugget. Then the chicken
was so much better. I really like chicken.
